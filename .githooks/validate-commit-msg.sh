#   printf '%s\n' "$msg" | .githooks/validate-commit-msg.sh -

# Exit 0 = valid, message may be committed.
# Exit 1 = invalid, with the specific reason on stderr. Do not commit.
# Exit 2 = usage error.
#
# The format itself is checked by .githooks/commit-msg, the one implementation,
# which git runs on every commit anyway. This adds only what holds for agents
# and not for people: the marker is required, and the description says enough.
# It is committed beside the hook so every clone has it; git runs only the
# hooks it has names for, so it never runs on its own.
